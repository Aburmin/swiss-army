This repository uses Ansible playbooks and roles to configure my workstation.
Supported operating systems include Fedora 28 or later and RHEL/CentOS 7.
The playbooks automate installation of base system installations and individual app installations.
Each playbook can modularly select different combinations of a base system and app roles.
