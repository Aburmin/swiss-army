Collection of user application configuration files, a.k.a. dotfiles, for my preferred environment


## About

This repo contains a collection of my configuration files for various user applications in a Linux environment.
Each application's configuration is found in a corresponding directory.
All configuration files are deployed and managed via Ansible.
For an automated setup, only two environments are supported: **Fedora** and **RHEL** systems.

However, other content for other application configurations may also be useful.
I try to document my configurations, both for me (when I forget six months later) and so others may find my tweaks useful.


## Using parts of my config in yours

This repository is licensed under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/ "BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License").
You can reuse anything you want in your own configurations.
If you publish your dotfiles on GitHub, a nod in your README is appreciated. :+1:
