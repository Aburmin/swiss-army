Ansible-driven configuration management for maintaining a preferred environment (base system and app configurations)


## About

swiss-army is my "swiss army knife" to set up and manage my preferred Linux environment.
It is a set of Ansible playbooks and roles.
Roles are split into two categories:

* `system`: base system configuration (e.g. package installation)
* `apps`: specific app installation and configuration (e.g. dotfile management)

For a fully automated setup, two environments are supported: **Fedora** and **CentOS/RHEL**.


## How to use

See [`docs/how-to-use.adoc`](https://github.com/jwflory/swiss-army/blob/master/docs/how-to-use.adoc "How to use jwflory/swiss-army").
